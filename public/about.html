      <h5>Social capital is a necessary tool for influencing those around us.
      To push back against today's harsh political tensions, Who Cares,
      aims to facilitate difficult political conversations by using social capital to encourage
      users to educate themselves.
<br>
<br>
      Who Cares prompts users to ‘check in’ each day by logging their primary
      political interest in the form of a colored dot, then stores their answer so that over
      time they can track if and how their political priorities evolve. Each month, users are provided
      with their dot visualized in a dashboard view so they can track their answers to watch the
      progression of their interests shift over time. After ‘checking in’, users are presented
      with a political article to read and respond to. All users of the site see the same daily article; their
      answer to what political issue is most relevant to them that day has no effect on what article they see.
      By presenting the same article to all users on the platform, the site encourages users to learn about
      political issues that they may not normally take the time to educate themselves about on their own.
<br>
<br>
    Aside from logging their personal political interests over time, our social network system provides users with a visualization of their network’s
    political priorities as well. At the end of each month, the system provides users with an anonymous visual data model to show how many of the connections in
    their network prioritized each political topic on the site, giving individuals a better sense of what issues their peers care most about without
    revealing who in their network specifically holds each priority. This anonymity helps to keep our site centered around showing users what political
    issues are most important to their network as a whole, rather than focusing on sharing specific political preferences or ideologies. Today it seems
    most political conversations can be very polarizing, which is why our site aims to recenter the discussion.
